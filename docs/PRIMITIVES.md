## Quick Decision Tree

Use this tree to decide which primitive a new capability belongs in.

```
Is the capability purely deterministic logic (>50 lines) that runs NO model?
 └─ YES → SCRIPT (Python-only deterministic helper). Wrap the script in a Skill,
           Command, Hook, Agent, or Gas City pack surface if the model/runtime
           needs to call it.
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Is it a fixed-shape orchestration of multiple subagents — deterministic control
flow that spawns fresh-context agents, the same shape every run, worth resuming?
 └─ YES → WORKFLOW (deterministic spine + model leaves — see primitives/workflow.md)
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Should the model auto-pick this up from context?
 └─ YES → SKILL (model-triggered, no user action needed)
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Does the user invoke it explicitly by typing a slash command?
 └─ YES → COMMAND (user-only trigger, /name syntax)
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Does it need an isolated context budget / own tool permissions?
 └─ YES → Is this a pre-action gate (decides whether a proposed side-effect may execute)?
           ├─ YES → JUDGE (specialization of Agent — see [Agent](primitives/agent.md#judge-specialization))
           └─ NO  → AGENT (own context window, own system prompt, own tool set)
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Must it fire regardless of what the model decides?
 └─ YES → GUARDRAIL / HOOK (runs outside the LLM loop)
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Is it a bundle of multiple primitives above?
 └─ YES → PLUGIN (installable unit containing skills/commands/agents/hooks)
          → Register it in a MARKETPLACE if you want it discoverable
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Is it project-specific or cross-cutting context supplementing global skills?
 └─ YES → STANDARD (injected into model context, not invokable)
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Is it an external capability provider accessed via the MCP protocol?
 └─ YES → Does the target harness have shell access?
           ├─ YES (Claude Code / Codex CLI) → Prefer CLI + SKILL over MCP
           └─ NO  (claude.ai web / Claude iOS) → MCP-SERVER is the only path

Does it provide model-specific behavioral guidance for an agent persona?
 └─ YES → MODEL-STANDARD
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Does it provide a shared base prompt layer for multiple agents (Layer 1
of the composed agent system prompt)?
 └─ YES → GOLDEN-PROMPT (a.k.a. "agent base prompt")
 └─ NO  → Continue below.

Does it replace or extend the ORCHESTRATOR's system prompt or tool set
(the prompt loaded by `cld` / `cdx` at session start, NOT an agent's prompt)?
 └─ YES → SYSTEM-PROMPT
```

> **Two distinct "system prompts" in this stack.** The decision tree
> distinguishes them because they live in different contexts:
>
> - **Orchestrator system prompt** ([system-prompt](primitives/system-prompt.md))
>   — top-level `cld` / `cdx` session. Default = vendor prompt; override via
>   CLI flags or the `system-prompts/registry.yml` mechanism.
> - **Agent system prompt** ([agent](primitives/agent.md) + Layer 1
>   [agent-base](primitives/agent-base.md) + Layer 3
>   [model-standard](primitives/model-standard.md)) — each spawned subagent.
>   Composed at install time by the Library.
>
> Subagents do **not** inherit the orchestrator's system prompt. Setting one
> does not affect the other.

Judge is the pre-action gate: it approves, rejects, or constrains a proposed
side-effect before execution. Reviewer and verification agents are post-action
checks; they inspect results after work has happened and do not authorize the
action itself.

| 13 | [Workflow](primitives/workflow.md) | **YES** — shared JS spec (Anthropic Workflow API) | native Workflow tool (gated by `CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS`) or Library runtime | Library runtime via `codex exec` (INFERRED) | n/a | n/a | n/a | details |

**How to read this:**
- **portable** = same source file works in multiple harnesses (no translation needed)
- **harness-specific** = each harness needs its own representation
- **n/a** = primitive does not exist in that harness's mental model
- Cells with `INFERRED` mean pending validation — see the per-primitive section.

## Primitive Reference

Detailed definitions now live in focused pages. The headings below preserve the old
anchors used by existing docs and external references.

### Action Boundary Metadata

Details: [Action Boundary Metadata](primitives/action-boundary.md).

### Plane And Projection Vocabulary

Details: [Plane And Projection Vocabulary](primitives/plane-vocabulary.md).

### Catalog Entry Fields: Harness Support and Runtime Requirements

Two optional fields apply to every catalog entry shape (`base_entry` and all
primitive entry types):

**`harness_support`** — per-harness install eligibility. Declare when a
primitive works in some harnesses but not others. The installer refuses
`--harness <h>` installs if the entry marks that harness `not-supported`.

```yaml
metadata:
  library:
    harness_support:
      claude_code: supported      # or not-supported, planned
      codex: not-supported
      cursor: planned
```

Harness IDs are a closed enum maintained by the Library schema, not an open
catalog-derived registry. Accepted IDs are `claude_code`, `codex`, `cursor`,
`opencode`, and `gemini`. Omitting a key means "no explicit claim" (install
proceeds). Use `planned` for harnesses where support is in progress. The install
gate fires before dependency installs to prevent partial mutations.

`metadata.library.harness_support` belongs to primitive entry metadata. MCP
server entries use `install.mcp` as the source of truth for harness-specific MCP
configuration, and project tooling entries use their `target_kind` and
conditions. Those planes intentionally do not carry `harness_support`.

**`runtime_requirements`** — binary prerequisites for the primitive to function.
Declare when the primitive requires CLI tools that may not be present on every
machine. The doctor check enforces these at install time.

```yaml
runtime_requirements:
  binaries:
    - bun
    - rg
```

**Plane enforcement.** Entries tagged `tier:domain` or `tier:project` must
declare `metadata.library.plane`. `validate-library.py` fails validation if
the field is absent. `tier:core` entries are exempt.

### 1. Skill

Details: [Skill](primitives/skill.md).

### 2. Command

Details: [Command](primitives/command.md).

### 3. Agent

Details: [Agent](primitives/agent.md). Judge remains a specialization of Agent.

### 4. Guardrail (Hook)

Details: [Guardrail / Hook](primitives/guardrail-hook.md).

### 5. Plugin

Details: [Plugin](primitives/plugin.md).

### 6. Marketplace

Details: [Marketplace](primitives/marketplace.md).

### 7. Standard

Details: [Standard](primitives/standard.md).

### 8. MCP-Server

Details: [MCP-Server](primitives/mcp-server.md).

### 9. Script

Details: [Script](primitives/script.md).

### 10. Model-Standard

Details: [Model-Standard](primitives/model-standard.md).

### 11. Agent Base (Agent Base Prompt)

Details: [Agent Base](primitives/agent-base.md). Layer 1 of the
composed **agent** system prompt. Distinct from the orchestrator system
prompt (see #12).

### 12. System-Prompt

Details: [System-Prompt](primitives/system-prompt.md). The **orchestrator**-level
system prompt + built-in tool set that `cld` / `cdx` loads at top-level session
start. Distinct from the agent system prompt (see #3, #10, #11). Subagents do
not inherit it.

### 13. Workflow

Details: [Workflow](primitives/workflow.md). A deterministic orchestration spec
(Anthropic Workflow JS API) whose control flow runs as code and whose leaves
spawn fresh-context model subagents. Distinct from **script** (#9 — runs no
model) and **agent** (#3 — a single context window, not control flow over many).
Established by [ADR-0006](adr/workflow-primitive.md).


## Precedence and Name Collision Policy

> Full policy: `docs/policy/name-collision.md` (CL-b4o). This section is a summary
> for primitive-taxonomy consumers. The policy document is authoritative.

### Install path precedence (within a harness)

For every harness, **project-local always overrides global** for the same skill name.

| Harness | Wins (project-local) | Loses (user-global) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/<name>` (bridge -> `.agents/skills/<name>`) | `~/.claude/skills/<name>` |
| Codex CLI | `.agents/skills/<name>` (canonical, read natively) | `~/.agents/skills/<name>` |

### Canonical vs. bridge

Every skill install creates the same three-layer structure:

| Role | Path |
|------|------|
| Layer B (real files, content-addressable) | `~/.local/share/library/skills/<m>/<n>@<tree-sha>/SKILL.md` |
| **Canonical** (Layer C) | `.agents/skills/<name>` real vendored copy by default |
| **Claude bridge** (Layer C) | `.claude/skills/<name>` → `.agents/skills/<name>` (symlink) |
| Codex | reads `.agents/skills/<name>` natively (r1 root, CL-603) — no install path |

The `.agents/skills/<name>` path is always canonical. The `.claude/skills/<name>`
path is always the Claude harness bridge symlink. Codex reaches the same
canonical files directly; no separate `.codex/skills/<name>` install target.
The Layer-B cache remains the resolver source; Layer C is committed content unless
the user explicitly installs with `--symlink` for local development.

### Name uniqueness requirement

Skill names MUST be globally unique within a project. Two real directories at
`.agents/skills/foo` and `.claude/skills/foo` (neither a symlink) are a policy
violation — bug reports from that state will be untriageable.

### Uninstall completeness

`/library remove` MUST remove the Claude bridge AND the canonical install AND
the lockfile entry. The removal sequence: Claude bridge first, then canonical,
then lockfile. The Layer-B cache (`~/.local/share/library/skills/...`) is
garbage-collected separately by `/library prune-cache` once no lockfile entry
references it.

### Admin override

Anthropic's marketplace force-enable operates outside Library's path rules.
Library treats managed skills as read-only and does not override them.
